                  GASTRIC BANDING
                </h3>
                <p>
                  A medical treatment for obesity is gastric banding. Such forms of
                  intervention are referred to as bariatric surgery. The procedure
                  constricts the stomach, so that after eating less food than normal, a
                  person feels full.
                  <br>
                  Fast facts on gastric band surgery
                  <br>Here are some key points about surgery on the gastric band. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>A type of weight loss, or bariatric, surgery is gastric band surgery.</li>
                    <li>To reduce food intake, it is a minimally invasive, quick, reversible
                      and flexible surgical procedure that reduces the size of the stomach.</li>
                      <li>It involves putting an inflatable band around the top of the
                        stomach, resulting in a person with less food feeling fuller.</li>
                        <li>After surgery, a strict liquid-only diet with the gradual
                          reintroduction of soft foods must be observed for up to 6 weeks.</li>
                          <li>Banding can lead to considerable weight loss and diabetes, but
                            weight loss varies considerably.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
               
            </div>
            <div data-aos="fade-up">
                <h3>How does it work.?</h3>
               <p>
                Gastric banding is a form of surgery for weight loss that involves
putting a silicone band around the upper part of the stomach to
minimise the size of the stomach and decrease the intake of food.
<br>
It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as a
weight loss medication (FDA). 
               </p>
               <p>
                The surgeon puts the band around the stomach's upper portion and
                adds a tube to the band. Under the skin of the abdomen, the tube is
                accessible via a port.<br>
                The surgeon injects saline solution into the band through this port to
inflate it. 
               </p>
               <p>
                The amount of constriction around the stomach may be altered by
                changes. A small stomach pouch above it is formed by the band, with
                the rest of the stomach below. 
               </p>
               <p>
                The amount of food that the stomach will carry at any time is
                decreased by having a smaller stomach pouch. The effect is an
                increased feeling of fullness after consuming a smaller amount of
                food. In exchange, this decreases appetite and helps lower the total
                consumption of food.
               </p>
               <p>
                An benefit of this type of bariatric procedure is that without
                malabsorption, it helps the body to digest as normal.

                SURGERY
              </h3>
              <p>
                Under general anaesthesia, a gastric band is mounted. In an
outpatient clinic, it is normally done, and the person usually goes later
on the same day. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The process is minimally invasive. It is carried out by incisions in the
keyhole. In the abdomen, between one and five minor surgical cuts
are made by the surgeon. Using a laparoscope, a long narrow tube
with a monitor, surgery is carried out. Sometimes the operation takes
30 to 60 minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                From midnight before the day of the procedure, the patient does not
feed. In 2 days, most individuals may resume most daily activities, but
they will need to take a week's leave from work.
              </p>
              <h3>DIET AFTER SURGERY :</h3>
              <p>
                The consumption of food must be reduced initially. 
                <ul>
                  <li>The diet is limited to water and fluids for the first few days, such as
                    thin soups. </li>
                    <li>
                      Liquids and blended foods such as yoghurt and puréed vegetables
can be consumed until the end of 4 weeks. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Soft foods are introduced from 4 to 6 weeks. 
                    </li>
                    <li> The person will resume a regular diet after 6 weeks.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h3>BENEFITS :</h3>
              <p>
                Laparoscopic gastric banding's benefits include: 
                <ul>
                  <li>The likelihood of weight loss for those with obesity in the long term </li>
                  <li>Relatively fast recovery</li>
                  <li>Less risk of wound infections and hernias following surgery </li>
                  <li> Decreased risk of diabetes, hypertension, urinary incontinence and
                    other disorders correlated with excess weight</li>
                    <li>
                      No lack of absorption of nutrients
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In certain cases, changes in the quality of life after surgery
                    </li>
                </ul>

              <h3>POLYPECTOMY</h3>
              <p>
                A polypectomy is a procedure, also called the large intestine, used to
extract polyps from the inside of the colon. An irregular array of
tissue is a polyp. The operation is generally non-invasive and is
usually done with a colonoscopy at the same time.
              </p>
              <h3>PURPOSE OF POLYPECTOMY</h3>
              <p>
                Many colon tumours develop as a benign (noncancerous)<br>
development until they become malignant (cancerous). 
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to detect the presence of any polyps, a colonoscopy is first
performed. If any are detected, a polypectomy is performed and the
tissue is removed. In order to decide whether the growths are
cancerous, precancerous, or benign, the tissue will be tested. Colon
cancer may prevent this. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Polyps are also not at all associated with any symptoms. Larger
polyps, however can cause:
<ul>
  <li>
    Rectal haemorrhage
  </li>
  <li> Pressure in the abdomen </li>
  <li> Intestinal abnormalities </li>
</ul>
A polypectomy can also assist in relieving these symptoms. This
procedure is required at any time during a colonoscopy when polyps
are found.
              </p>
              <h3>PROCEDURE</h3>
              <p>Usually, a polypectomy is performed at the same time as a
                colonoscopy. During a colonoscopy, a colonoscope may be inserted
                into your rectum so your doctor can see all segments of your colon. A
                colonoscope with a camera and a light at the end of it is a long thin,
                flexible tube.</p>
                <p>
                  For people over 50 years of age, a colonoscopy is regularly given to
search for any development that could be suggestive of cancer.
During your colonoscopy, if your doctor discovers polyps, they will
usually perform a polypectomy at the same time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are many ways in which it is possible to execute a polypectomy.
It will depend on what kind of polyps are in the colon what direction
the doctor prefers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Polyps may be tiny, huge, pedunculated, or sessile. Sessile polyps are
flat and have no stalks at all. Pedunculated polyps develop like
mushrooms on stalks. Biopsy forceps may be used for removal in the
case of small polyps (less than 5 millimetres in diameter). Using a
snare, larger polyps may be removed (up to 2 centimetres in
diameter). 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your doctor will loop a thin wire around the bottom of the polyp
during snare polypectomy and use heat to cut off the growth. Any
tissue or stalk that remains is then cauterised.
                </p>
                <h3>How long is it going to take to recover?</h3>
                <p>
                  Following a polypectomy, you can not drive for 24 hours. <br>
                  Recovery is normally rapid. Minor side effects typically resolve within
24 hours, such as gas, bloating, and cramps. A complete recovery will
take up to two weeks with a more involved procedure. <br>
Your doctor will provide you with some guidance for how to take care
of yourself. For two or three days after the operation, they can ask
you to avoid some beverages and foods that may irritate your
digestive system.
<ul>
  <li>tea</li>
  <li>coffee</li>
  <li>soda</li>
  <li>alcohol</li>
  <li>Spicy foods</li>
</ul>Your doctor will also schedule you for a follow-up colonoscopy. It is
important to verify that the polypectomy has been successful and
that no new polyps have formed.
<br>
What risks and side effects are there? 
<br>
The hazards of a polypectomy can include intestinal perforation or
rectal bleeding. For a colonoscopy, these threats are similar.
Complications are uncommon, but if you have any of the following
symptoms, contact your physician immediately:
<ul>
  <li>
    fever or chills, as these could indicate an infection
  </li>

              <h3>METAL STENTS 
              </h3>
<p>
  The initial treatment choice for pancreatic fluid collections is called
endoscopic transmural drainage. In addition to emerging data on bile
duct and gallbladder drainage, lumen-apposing metal stents have
recently been developed for drainage of pancreatic fluid collections
under endoscopic ultrasound guidance. 
</p>
<p>
  With the reporting of pooled data analysis on technological
performance, clinical success and complication rate of endoscopic
ultrasound-guided lumen-apposing metal stents, we aimed to
conduct a systematic examination. A MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE
search was performed for all lumen-apposing metal stent studies
used for pancreatic, biliary and other indications. Security, problems,
and yield data have been extracted and used in the final pooled
analysis.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, 19 articles dealing with pancreatic fluid collections drainage,
18 articles reporting on bile duct drainage and 19 articles related to
gallbladder drainage were reported. In all disease states,
technological and clinical achievements were high and achieved more
than 95 percent . The incidence of complications in the accumulation
of pancreatic fluid, bile duct and gallbladder drainage was 12%, 11.2%
and 9.8%, respectively. Endoscopic lumen-guided ultrasoundapposing metal stents are technically feasible with very high success
rate and acceptable complications rate.
