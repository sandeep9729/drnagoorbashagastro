                    COLONOSCOPY :
                </h3>
                <p>
                    An examination used to detect changes or anomalies in the large intestine (colon) and rectum is a colonoscopy (koe-lun-OS-kuh-pee). A long flexible tube (colonoscope) is inserted into the rectum during a colonoscopy. At the tip of the vent, a small video camera helps the doctor to see the inside of the entire colon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Polyps or other forms of irregular tissue may be removed during a colonoscopy via the lens, if appropriate. You can take tissue samples (biopsies) during a colonoscopy as well.
                </p>
                <h3>Why is that done? </h3>
                <p>
                    A colonoscopy may be recommended by your doctor for:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Investigate the symptoms and intestinal signs : </h3>Your doctor will be
                    able to investigate potential causes of abdominal discomfort, rectal
                    bleeding, persistent constipation, chronic diarrhoea, and other
                    intestinal issues by using a colonoscopy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Digital colon cancer screen : </h3> If you are 50 years of age or older and
                    have an average risk of colon cancer, your doctor may prescribe a
                    colonoscopy every 10 years or sometimes sooner to check for colon
                    cancer if you have no risk factors other than age. A colonoscopy is
                    one method for screening for colon cancer. Speak about your choices
                    with your doctor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Check for additional polyps : </h3>Your doctor can prescribe a follow-up
                    colonoscopy if you have had polyps before to check for and remove
                    any additional polyps. In order to reduce the risk of colon cancer, this
                    is done.

                <h3>Risks : </h3>
                <p>
                    There are few complications associated with a colonoscopy. In rare
                    cases, colonoscopy complications can include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Adverse reaction during the exam to the sedative used.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bleeding from the place where a sample of tissue (biopsy) was taken or a polyp or other irregular tissue was extracted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A tear in the wall of the colon or rectum (perforation).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Your doctor will ask you to sign a consent form approving the operation after discussing the dangers of a colonoscopy with you.
                </p>
                <h3>How you prepare yourself : </h3>
                <p>
                    You'll need to clean your (empty) colon before a colonoscopy. The view of your colon and rectum during the examination can be blurred by any residue in your colon.
                </p>
                <h4>Your doctor may ask you to empty the colon by asking : </h4>
                <p>
                    <h3>The day before your test, observe a special diet : </h3>Usually, the day
                    before the test, you would not be able to eat solid food. Drinks may
                    be restricted to clear beverages without milk or cream, broth, and
                    carbonated drinks: plain water, tea and coffee. Ignore red liquids,
                    which during a colonoscopy can be confused with blood. The night
                    before the test, you will not be able to eat or drink anything after
                    midnight. Observe a special diet the day before the examination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Take a laxative : </h3> Usually, the doctor would prescribe that you take a
                    laxative, either in pill form or in liquid form. The night before your
                    colonoscopy, you may be advised to take the laxative, or you may be
                    asked to use the laxative both the night before and the morning after
                    the operation.Take a laxative. Usually, the doctor would prescribe that
                    you take a laxative, either in pill form or in liquid form. The night
                    before your colonoscopy, you may be advised to take the laxative, or
                    you may be asked to use the laxative both the night before and the
                    morning after the operation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Using an enema kit : </h3>In certain cases, to clear your colon, you can
                    need to use an over-the-counter enema kit, either the night before
                    the test or a few hours before the exam. In general, this is only useful
                    for emptying the lower colon and is not generally recommended as a
                    primary way to empty the colon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Adjust your medications : </h3> At least a week before the test, inform
                    your doctor of your medications, particularly if you have diabetes,
                    high blood pressure or heart issues, or if you are taking ironcontaining medications or supplements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even notify your doctor whether you are taking aspirin or other bloodthinning drugs, such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven); new
                    anticoagulants, such as dabigatran (Pradaxa) or rivaroxaban
                    (Xarelto), which are used to minimise the risk of stroke or blood clots;
                    or platelet-affecting medications, such as clopidogrel (Plavix). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will need to change the dosages or briefly stop taking the drugs.
                </p>

                <h3>LIVER PROBLEMS :</h3> 
                <p>
                    The liver is an organ about the size of a football., On the right side of
                    your belly, it lies just behind your rib cage. The liver is necessary for
                    digesting food and ridding the body of toxic substances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is possible to inherit Liver Disease (genetic). A number of factors
                    that harm the liver, such as viruses, alcohol use and obesity, can also
                    cause liver problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time, diseases that damage the liver can lead to a lifethreatening condition called scarring (cirrhosis), which can lead to
                    liver failure. But early treatment may allow time for the liver to heal.
                </p>

                    Liver disease doesn't often cause signs and symptoms that are apparent. If liver disease signs and symptoms do occur, they can include:

                <p>If you have any recurring signs or symptoms that bother you, make an
                    appointment with your physician. If you have stomach pain that is so
                    serious that you can't stand still, seek urgent medical attention.

                <p>
                    The liver may be invaded by parasites and viruses, causing
                    inflammation that decreases liver function. Via blood or semen,
                    tainted food or water, or near contact with an infected person, viruses

                    the most common forms of liver infection, including: <br>
                    Hepatitis A<br>
                    Hepatitis B <br>
                    Hepatitis C
                </p>
                <h3>Abnormalism of the immune system : </h3>
                <p>
                    Your liver may be damaged by diseases in which your immune system
                    attacks some parts of your (autoimmune) body. Examples of liver
                    disorders that are autoimmune include: <br>
                    Hepatitis Autoimmune <br>
                    Primary biliary cholangitis<br>
                    Primary sclerosing cholangitis
                </p>
                <h3>Genetics</h3>
                <p>
                    An irregular gene inherited from one or both of your parents will cause your liver to build up different substances, resulting in damage to the liver. Among the hereditary liver disorders are: <br>
                    Hemochromatosis <br>
                    Disease of Wilson<br>
                    Deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin
                </p>
                <h3>Cancer and other developments</h3>
                <p>Examples are: <br>
                    Cancers of the liver<br>
                    Cancer in bile ducts<br>
                    Adenoma of the Liver<br>
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Other
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Some prevalent causes of liver disease include : <br>
                    Chronic misuse of alcohol<br>
                    Accumulating fat in the liver (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease)<br>
                    Certain drugs for prescription or over-the-counter<br>
                    Certain compounds of herbs<br>

                <p>To stop liver disease: </p>
                </div>
                <div data-aos="fade-up">
                <p><h3>Drink alcohol in moderation : </h3>That means up to one drink a day for
                    females for healthy adults and up to two drinks a day for males. More
                    than eight drinks a week for women and more than 15 drinks a week
                    for men are described as heavy or high-risk drinking.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Just get vaccinated : </h3> Speak to your doctor about getting hepatitis A
                    and hepatitis B vaccines if you are at elevated risk of contracting
                    hepatitis or if you have already been infected with some sort of
                    hepatitis virus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Using drugs carefully : </h3>Taking prescription and non-prescription
                    medications only when required and in prescribed doses only. Don't
                    combine alcohol and drugs. Before combining herbal supplements or
                    prescription or nonprescription medications, consult with your doctor. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Avoid contact with the blood and bodily fluids of other individuals :</h3> Accidental needle sticks or improper cleaning of blood or
                    body fluids may spread hepatitis viruses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Keep food safe for you : </h3> Before eating or cooking food, wash your 
                    hands thoroughly. Using bottled water to drink, wash your hands and
                    brush your teeth while travelling in a developing world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>For aerosol sprays, take note : </h3>In a well-ventilated environment, be
                    sure to use these items and wear a mask when spraying insecticides,
                    fungicides, paint and other toxic chemicals. Often follow orders from
                    the manufacturer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Have your skin covered : </h3>Wear gloves, long sleeves, a hat and a
                    mask when using insecticides and other toxic substances, so that
                    chemicals are not absorbed into your skin. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Maintain a balanced weight : </h3>Obesity can cause disease of the
                    nonalcoholic fatty liver.
